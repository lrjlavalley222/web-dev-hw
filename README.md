** WHY **- I decided to join this class because I failed it once. I couldn't give my full participation and I really want another go about it. I do not give up and I am going to master this course and understand this technology that I use every single day.

** Internet **
- I thought it was interesting that it was a project created to withstand a nuclear bomb.
- Paul Baran decided to break up messages in a mesh network and it turned out to be a success.
- The Internet is not owned by anyone but it is also owned by everyone through infinite amounts of independently operated networks and packages of information.
- The internet is quite literally a wire in the ground.
