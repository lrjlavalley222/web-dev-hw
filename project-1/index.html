      You see, I'm trapped in my mind, oh, I'm going trippy
      Oh, I don't think I'll ever go
      You see the walls are so high that I couldn't climb them
      So I don't know which way to roll

      Well, I'm stuck in rewind though I'm looking forward
      Damn, I wish I knew what went wrong
      I'm sick and I'm ill, my mental got me
      Oh Lord, please help me pull through

      You see the sun seems to shine when I am not looking
      Oh, it seems a trick every time
      Things do get out of hand once a while inside my mental
      Hey, I took a hell of a run

      When I see what a soul I know I am not lucky
      Yeah, I like to pat my own back
      It's a gift and a curse since my birth, I'm in a prison
      Oh, I'm happy right where I'm at
